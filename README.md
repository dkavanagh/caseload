# caseload
A web application load tester driven by specific application use cases to simulate actual usage.
While some load testers use real browsers and click random links on your application to generate load, this project differs in two ways. First, it doesn't use browsers and so requires far less resources to generate the same load and second, it relies on actual use cases, not random clicks.
